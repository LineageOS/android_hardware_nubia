      "message": "First, we need to separate the RGB LED/Light strip/Logo Led. Secondly, we only need to define backlight for lcd devices (oled devices don\u0027t need to be specially defined on the hal side). Finally, for old RGB LED devices (create nodes under /sys/class/leds/nubia_led/ to define colors, modes or intervals), special handling is also required. Don\u0027t merge commits related to light hal yet, I\u0027ll take care of that soon.",

      "message": "I do agree we need some conditionals for various stuff. What I\u0027m not sure about is if back led and especially the strip led should be handled directly in here. Specifically because I see back led(s) and front led as two separate stuff, one shouldn\u0027t be forced to enable back leds just because he wants to have a notification light in the front. So at least for the strip led specifically, I\u0027d make another HAL and have that handled in a parts UI app, or something similar anyway, while for the back logo led I still have to think about it, but for sure I wouldn\u0027t want to force users to either turn off leds completely or have the back led force enabled.",
